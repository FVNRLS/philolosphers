# philolosphers

This project is a training for multi-thread/multi-process programming with the use of mutex and semaphore.
Two different variants are used to simulate and solve the famous Dining Philosophers problem.
The project also teaches optimization and parralessing of processes. This is done directly with CPU control to ensure the existence of the philosophers.

The project is divided into 2 parts: Mandatory and Bonus.

If you are a 42 student visiting this project, please do not blindly copy the solution and make sure you always understand the code you write. 
The solution approach of the project lies in the basic understanding of the threads commands such as: 
usleep, gettimeofday, pthread_create, pthread_detach, pthread_join, thread_mutex_init, pthread_mutex_destroy, pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_mutex_unlock.
